# Financial Transaction Analysis

## Project Overview

The **Financial Transaction Analysis** project aims to process, clean, and analyze financial transaction data to derive actionable insights. This project will help businesses or financial institutions understand their transaction patterns, customer behaviors, and regional trends, and make data-driven decisions.

In this project, I utilize tools such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to analyze and visualize the data. The key objectives include exploring transaction types, calculating balances, detecting anomalies, and creating visualizations that highlight trends in the dataset.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains transaction records with the following columns:

- **Transaction ID**: A unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Customer ID**: The ID of the customer initiating the transaction.
- **Date**: The date and time when the transaction took place.
- **Transaction Type**: Type of transaction (e.g., Withdrawal, Deposit, Transfer).
- **Amount**: The monetary amount involved in the transaction.
- **Currency**: The currency used in the transaction (e.g., USD, EUR).
- **Balance After Transaction**: The account balance after the transaction.
- **Region**: The geographical region where the transaction was processed.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, convert data types (like dates), and normalize numerical data.
- **Data Analysis**: Calculate total transaction amounts by type, identify regional patterns, and calculate balances after each transaction.
- **Outlier Detection**: Use statistical methods to identify and remove outliers in transaction amounts.
- **Visualization**: Use various types of plots to visualize trends, such as transaction frequencies, distributions of amounts, and regional comparisons.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build a model to predict the transaction type based on the amount, date, and region.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following libraries and tools:

- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data processing, cleaning, and advanced manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating basic visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and histograms.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualizations, particularly heatmaps and distribution plots.

## Project Workflow

### Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**: Remove rows with missing values, convert dates to `datetime` objects, and ensure all columns have appropriate data types.
- **Normalization**: Normalize the monetary values to a range from 0 to 1 to make comparisons easier.
- **Data Transformation**: Convert the transaction amounts to integers and calculate averages for various transaction categories.

### Data Analysis

- **Total Amounts**: Calculate the total amount for each transaction type, such as withdrawals and deposits.
- **Region-Based Analysis**: Group data by region and calculate the total transaction amounts for each region.
- **Balance Calculations**: Compute the balance after each transaction to track financial movements.
- **Statistical Metrics**: Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of transaction amounts to understand financial volatility.

### Outlier Detection and Anomaly Handling

- **Outlier Identification**: Use methods like the Z-score or Interquartile Range (IQR) to detect and remove outliers, ensuring that analysis results are not skewed by extreme values.
- **Moving Average**: Apply a rolling moving average to smooth out transaction amounts and observe overall trends.

### Visualization

- **Heatmaps**: Create heatmaps to show transaction frequency by region and transaction type, identifying patterns and areas for optimization.
- **Bar and Line Charts**: Use bar charts to display total transaction amounts by type and line charts to visualize transaction trends over time.

### Predictive Modeling

- **Transaction Classification**: Build a machine learning model that can predict whether a transaction is a "Withdrawal" or a "Deposit" based on features like amount, date, and region. This can be used to automate transaction categorization in a financial system.

## Key Insights

- **Spending Trends**: Analyzing the total amount spent over time and by transaction type can help businesses identify spending patterns and budget accordingly.
- **Regional Insights**: By grouping transactions by region, we can identify areas with high financial activity and tailor services to specific regions.
- **Volatility Analysis**: The standard deviation of transaction amounts provides insight into the financial volatility of users, which could be used for risk assessments.
